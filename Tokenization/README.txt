HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
Since the program refers to external libraries. I am submitting an executable JAR file along with the source code, so that nothing needs to be build sepeartely. 
Kindly use the following command to run the program.

$ java -jar Tokenizer-Stemmer.jar

This JAR file gives the output for both the problems.
